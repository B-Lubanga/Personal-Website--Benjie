            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Benjamin Lubanga, a fullstack development graduate from Moringa Tech School with a background in mechanical engineering. I specialize in both frontend and backend development, working with HTML, CSS, React for user interfaces and Python, JavaScript for backend systems to build dynamic, scalable applications. My focus is on creating seamless, high-performance solutions that enhance user experience and system efficiency.</p>
            <P>I’m passionate about backend engineering and leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. My interests extend to AI and data analysis, which I believe can drive smarter, data-driven decision-making. I’m also deeply committed to sustainability and environmental impact, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—particularly in clean energy, climate action, sustainable cities, and the green economy. I aspire to contribute to tech-driven solutions that support sustainability, promote resource efficiency, and reduce environmental footprints. Outside work, I’m a biking enthusiast, with a dream of adventure riding through remote areas to explore life beyond the familiar.</P>
            <P>My mechanical engineering background, combined with fullstack development expertise, gives me a strong analytical and problem-solving approach. I thrive in collaborative environments, constantly seek innovative solutions, and explore emerging technologies like AI and data analytics to optimize backend systems. My ability to merge engineering principles with software development allows me to design efficient, scalable, and impact-driven solutions.</P>
            <P>I’m seeking backend engineering roles in mid-level startups focused on innovation, sustainability, and impactful technology. If you need a dedicated engineer who delivers scalable solutions, values sustainability, and embraces continuous learning, let’s connect and build something meaningful together.</P>

            <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
            <p>When I’m not coding, I immerse myself in activities that fuel my curiosity and passion for exploration. I aspire to be an adventure biker, drawn to the thrill of discovering remote places and experiencing life beyond the familiar. I find joy in cycling, swimming, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography, with a focus on landscapes and environmental conservation.</p>
            <p>Beyond the outdoors, I enjoy playing chess, reading books, and watching documentaries, always seeking to expand my knowledge. I also have a deep love for cars, appreciating both their engineering and the freedom they represent. Through my hobbies, I aim to connect with like-minded individuals and inspire a sustainable, adventurous, and well-rounded lifestyle.</p>
